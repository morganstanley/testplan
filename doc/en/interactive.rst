.. _Interactive:

Running Tests Interactively
***************************

.. note::
  Testplan should be installed with ``interactive`` extra in order to use
  interactive mode feature.

Introduction
============

In addition to the default mode, which is to run all selected tests in a single
batch and output results at the end, Testplan supports a second mode of use
known as the "interactive mode". When running in interactive mode, individual
testcases and testsuites may be run on-demand and test environments may
similarly be controlled on-demand.

The basic usage is to run your testplan as normal but with a "-i" flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python test_plan.py -i
    ...
    Interactive Testplan web UI is running. Access it at:
        Local: http://localhost:39514/interactive/
        On Your Network: http://10.2.3.4:39514/interactive/

Why is this useful? The idea is that, while running all tests in a big batch is
fine for fast unit tests or for running longer-running tests on a CI server,
the interactive mode provides a convenient interface for engineers to start up
a testing environment locally and iterate on running testcases against that
environment. To assist with fast iteration, Testplan's interactive mode has an
automatic code-reloading feature which allows testcases to be tweaked, added or
rewritten and then run without having to restart the main Testplan process or
interrupt processes started as part of the test environment.

.. _Interactive_Reload:

How code reloading works
------------------------
Code-reloading is triggered by reload API request, there is a reload button on UI.
Testplan will find modules to reload - those who have either been modified or have
had their dependencies modified. For the sake of efficiency, Testplan only looks
under the directory of the main script , as well as those directories where task
targets are located. User can instruct testplan to look further by using
``extra_deps`` parameter of ``@test_plan`` decorator.

The steps of the reload process are described below:

* When starting up the interactive mode, testplan builds a graph of dependencies
  used by the ``__main__`` module. Only dependencies that are within the same
  directory as the testplan script are included. Dependencies are resolved using
  `modulefinder.ModuleFinder <https://docs.python.org/3/library/modulefinder.html#modulefinder.ModuleFinder>`_
* Dependencies are checked and reloaded on reload API. When reloading modules testplan will:

  * Walk the graph of dependencies starting from ``__main__``.
  * For each module, if any of its dependencies were reloaded or the file has
    been modified since last reloaded, then reload this module and update
    ``__class__`` of all suites it defines.

* The interactive report is updated with any changed test cases.

There are a few known limitations that reload doesn't always work under certain
circumstances.

* ``__main__`` module (i.e. test_plan.py) cannot be reloaded. Because of this,
  it is recommended that test suites are defined in seperate modules. It is a
  good idea to keep the main script simple.
* Testplan is not able to reload module that is under **Namespace Package**, the
  workaround is to add dummy ``__init__.py`` file.
* Unlike testcases that can be added/removed/modified, adding/removing/renaming
  testsuite class will not take effect after reloading.
* Modules or objects imported using ``from some_module import *`` syntax are
  not guaranteed to be properly reloaded. Such syntax is not encouraged in
  Python anyway as it may bring naming conflicts.
* In interactive mode, all modules containing test targets will be loaded at
  the same time, if the modules from which tasks are scheduled have the same
  name, they won't be reloaded properly.
* `modulefinder.ModuleFinder <https://docs.python.org/3/library/modulefinder.html#modulefinder.ModuleFinder>`_
  works purely on static analysis, which means it can handle the following cases
  in the current module:

  * Absolute import from the top-level package containing the current module.
  * Relative import from the current module to its sibling modules.

  It is completely ignorant of any programmatic import as well as import
  requiring ``sys.path`` manipulation. Such dependencies will not be included
  in the graph thus not reloaded. User can use the ``extra_deps`` parameter of
  the ``@test_plan`` decorator to specify these dependencies manually.


.. _Interactive_UI:

Web UI
======

The main intended way to control Testplan in the interactive mode is via a web
UI provided as part of the Testplan package. When a Testplan is run
interactively, a local web server will be started to serve the UI page and
links to access will be printed. The UI server listens on all IP addresses
owned by your host, so may be accessed via localhost or over your LAN - useful
if you run your Testplan on a Linux server but want to access the web UI from
your Windows desktop for example.

Once loaded, the UI should look something like this:

.. image:: ../images/interactive/interactive_ui.png

If you have used the web UI for the batch mode you should find the
interactive UI familiar, with some differences. The navigation structure is
the same - you can click on entries on the navigation bar on the left to dig
down into particular testsuites. The first major difference from the batch UI
is that there are initially no testcase results - no tests have been run yet!
You may run testcases by clicking the "Play" icons next to them in the
navigation bar. Test results will appear in the main central section when
they are available. In addition to running single testcases, you can also run
all testcases in a testsuite or all testsuites in a Test environment in a
similar way.

Test environments will be automatically started as required. However, you may
also start or stop a test environment manually by clicking the toggle icon
found only on top-level Test environments:

.. image:: ../images/interactive/env_control.png


.. _Interactive_Config:

Configuration
=============

By default, the interactive web server will listen on an ephemeral port,
however you may override that by passing a port number after the "-i"
option on the command-line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python test_plan.py -i 4000
    ...
    Interactive Testplan web UI is running. Access it at:
        Local: http://localhost:4000/interactive/
        On Your Network: http://10.2.3.4:4000/interactive/

Alternatively, a testplan may be programmed to always run in interactive mode.
You may do this by setting the `interactive_port` parameter to any valid port
number, including port 0 to use an ephemeral port.

.. code-block:: python

    @test_plan(
        name="My awesome testplan",
        interactive_port=0,
    )
    def main(plan):
        ...


.. _Interactive_API:

Interactive API
===============

Testplan's web UI communicates with the backend via a RESTful HTTP API. For
most people this is an implementation detail you don't need to care about.
However, for an advanced user, you may want to design your own client
application which consumes the Testplan API. This could allow for an alternate
UI (Testplan mobile app anyone? We accept PRs). Alternatively, the API could be
used for automated control of Testplan environments and tests from another test
framework entirely - if for example you are a Java developer, you could write
your testcases in Java using JUnit but make API calls to a Testplan process to
control your test environment before and after running tests. There are many
similar possibilities!

When Testplan is started in interactive mode with debug logging enabled, as
well as displaying a link to the web UI it will also display a link to view and
interact with the API schema, using a generated Swagger UI. Take a look at the
schema if you would like to learn more.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python test_plan.py -di
    ...
    Interactive Testplan API is running. View the API schema:
        Local: http://localhost:36718/api/v1/interactive/
        On Your Network: http://10.174.117.110:36718/api/v1/interactive/
    ...
