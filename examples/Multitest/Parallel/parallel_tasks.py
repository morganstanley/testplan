    Example test suite. The test cases are split into two different execution
    groups. Only tests from the same group will be executed in parallel with
    each other - the groups overall are executed serially. To demonstrate
    this, each test acquires one of two resources that cannot both be acquired
    in parallel.

    You will find that modifying a single test from the "first" group to acquire
    the "second" resource (or vice-versa) will cause the test to fail.

    NOTE: when running a parallel MultiTest, all testcases from a given
    execution group are run together, regardless of the order they are defined
    within the testsuite class. Each execution group is run separately from all
    others. This is in contrast to the default serial mode, where testcases
    are run serially in the order they are defined within the testsuite class.
