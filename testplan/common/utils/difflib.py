This file is base on the difflib from python standard library (version: 2.7.9)
it provides diff (context/unified) functions with more options like GNU diff,
including: --ignore-space-change, --ignore-whitespace, --ignore-blank-lines
Due to the different algorithm, its output might be a slightly difference
compared with that of gnu diff or windiff, but it won't lead to confusing.

Module difflib -- helpers for computing deltas between objects.

Function context_diff(a, b):
    For two lists of strings, return a delta in context diff format.

class SequenceMatcher:
    """
    SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of
    any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic
    algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm
    published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
    hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
    elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.

    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
    catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
    to synching up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
    ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
    "junk" <wink>.

    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
    ...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
    ...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
    >>>

    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 3))
    0.866
    >>>

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:

    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
    ...     print("a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block)
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
    ...     print("%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode)
     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

class Differ:

    Differ is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and
    producing human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses
    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    Use get_opcodes() and get_merged_opcodes() to get a list of 5-tuples
    describing how to turn a into b. The former can give detailed
    transformation steps, especially the 'replace' operation for similar
    lines will be recorded, it is userful for ndiff (not implemented in
    this file), the latter gives concise transformation steps by merging
    adjacent op items if they can be merged. get_grouped_opcodes() is used
    for context_diff() and unified_diff().

    Example: Comparing two texts.

        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

        The two optional keyword parameters are for filter functions:

        - `linejunk`: A function that should accept a single string argument,
          and return true iff the string is junk. The module-level function
          `IS_LINE_JUNK` may be used to filter out lines without visible

          to leave linejunk None; as of Python 2.3, the underlying
          SequenceMatcher class has grown an adaptive notion of "noise" lines
          that's better than any static definition the author has ever been
          able to craft.

        - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The
          module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out
          whitespace characters (a blank or tab; **note**: bad idea to include
          newline in this!).  Use of IS_CHARACTER_JUNK is recommended.

        - `ignore_space_change`: refer to gnu diff option -b

# With respect to junk, an earlier version of ndiff simply refused to
# *start* a match with a junk element.  The result was cases like this:
#     before: private Thread currentThread;
#     after:  private volatile Thread currentThread;
# If you consider whitespace to be junk, the longest contiguous match
# not starting with junk is "e Thread currentThread".  So ndiff reported
# that "e volatil" was inserted between the 't' and the 'e' in "private".
# While an accurate view, to people that's absurd.  The current version
# looks for matching blocks that are entirely junk-free, then extends the
# longest one of those as far as possible but only with matching junk.
# So now "currentThread" is matched, then extended to suck up the
# preceding blank; then "private" is matched, and extended to suck up the
# following blank; then "Thread" is matched; and finally ndiff reports
# that "volatile " was inserted before "Thread".  The only quibble
# remaining is that perhaps it was really the case that " volatile"
# was inserted after "private".  I can live with that <wink>.
