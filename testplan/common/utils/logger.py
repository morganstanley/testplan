"""
This module provides an interface from testplan to the standard python
logging module. It defines some extra logging levels and handles setting up
separate handlers for logging to stdout and to a file under the runpath.

The logging facility is used for:
    - Overall Testplan status
    - Driver status updates & logs
    - Worker & pool messages
    - Test progress information (e.g. Pass / Fail status)
    - Exporter statuses
